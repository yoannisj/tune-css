# Tune-css

A configurable base stylesheet for all browsers and devices.

Tune-css brings the essentials of [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [fluidity](https://github.com/mrmrs/fluidity) and [html5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) together and allows you to configure the defaults they set using sass. 

Tune-css also sets vertical-rhythm using the techniques described by Harry Roberts [here](http://csswizardry.com/2012/06/single-direction-margin-declarations/), and it includes defaults from Adam Morse's [Links](http://mrmrs.io/links/) and [Buttons](http://mrmrs.io/btns/). But these more opinionated styles can easily be removed using the configuration options.

## Credits

Tune-css started as a fork from John Albin's [normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss), a normalize.css port to Sass. It allows more fine-grainded tuning out of the box, tests for browser support more precisely, and adds more opinionated styles.

These additions come mainly from the works of [Adam Morse](http://mrmrs.cc/) and [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/).
