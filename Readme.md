# Tune-css

A configurable base stylesheet for all browsers and devices.

Tune-css brings the essentials [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [fluidity](https://github.com/mrmrs/fluidity) and [html5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) together and allows you to configure the defaults they set using sass.
